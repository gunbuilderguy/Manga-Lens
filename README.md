# Manga-Lens
A quick and dirty tampermonkey script that vastly improves reading the translated image:

# features:
 - [x] Rearanged UI
 - [x] Dark Theme
 - [ ] OverMenu to sequentially read multipage works (manga aggregator links and the likes), providing "next" and "back" buttons to automatically bring the next/previous page
 - [ ] SubMenu to:
   - [ ] Change tranlated text size, color etc...
   - [ ] Switch Dark Theme
   - [ ] Add PR'd features
      
# OverMenu:
The future step of the project:
Allows you to enter links or partial links (ex: `https://chapmanganato.to/manga-ca979609` can be shortened to `manga-ca979609` or `manga-ca979609/chapter-40` for a specific chapter).

The entered link allows the reader to sequentially read each page of a given chapter of a work, giving Google Lens the next image to translate.
